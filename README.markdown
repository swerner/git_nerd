Git\_Nerd.vim
===========

git\_nerd.vim is a NERDTree plugin to add visual indications of a file's
git status to quickly see which files you have staged, unstaged and
modified, or deleted in your project without any extra work.


Installation
------------

At the moment git\_nerd doesn't work with NERDTree, but the hooks for
customizing tree nodes are in the works and should be coming out fairly
soon.

Until then, if you'd like to help work on or test git\_nerd, [my fork of
of NERDTree](https://github.com/swerner/nerdtree/tree/display_string_hooks) has
some temporary hooks to work with.

Place git\_nerd.vim in your ~\\.vim\\nerdtree\_plugin\\ directory along
with replacing your NERD\_tree.vim with the one from my fork and you'll
be good to go.
